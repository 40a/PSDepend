SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PSDepend is a module to simplify dependency handling

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    PSDepend is a module to simplify dependency handling

    Think of this like a simplified (Ruby) Bundler, or (Python) pip requirements files

    Terminology and concepts
    ========================
    There are three primary concepts:

        *.depend.psd1 files:    PSD1 files that tell PSDepend what you want to install

        Dependency Type:        These define how to actually install something.
                                Each type is associated with a script.
                                The default type is PSGalleryModule.
                                This is extensible.

        Deployment Script:      These are scripts associated to a particular dependency type.
                                They tell PSDepend how to install a dependency type.
                                All should accept a 'Dependency' parameter.
                                For example, the PSGalleryModule script uses PowerShellGet to find
                                and install any dependencies specified in a depend.psd1 file.


    Example use (*.PSDepend.ps1)
    ===========

    I want to install dependencies from C:\projectx\projectx.depend.psd1

        C:\projectx\projectx.depend.psd1 looks like this:

            @{
                psdeploy = @{
                    Version = '0.1.8'
                    Target = 'C:\ProjectX'
                    DependencyType = 'PSGalleryModule'
                }
                buildhelpers = @{
                    Target = 'CurrentUser'
                }
                pester = 'latest' 
                psake = '4.6.0'
            }

        # Install dependencies
        cd C:\projectx
        Invoke-PSDepend

        # Alternatively
        Invoke-PSDepend -Path C:\projectx

    Extending PSDepend
    ==================
    PSDepend is somewhat extensible. To add a new dependency type:

        Update PSDependMap.psd1 in the PSDepend root.

            The dependency type name is the root node.
            The script node defines what script to run for these dependency types
            The description is... not really used. But feel free to write one!

            For example, I might add support for PackageManagement, and include a long and shorthand way to name these:

              Package:
                Script: Package.ps1
                Description: Install packages via PackageManagement module

              PackageManagement:
                Script: Package.ps1
                Description: Install packages via PackageManagement module

        Create the associated script in PSDepend\PSDependScripts

            For example, I would create \\Path\To\PSDepend\PSDependScripts\Package.ps1

        Include a 'Dependency' parameter.

            See \\Path\To\PSDepend\PSDependScripts\PSGalleryModule.ps1 for an example

            Here's how I implement this:
                param(
                    [psobject[]]$Dependency
                    ...

        Update deploy.ps1 schema as needed.

            Get-Dependency converts PSD1 files into a number of 'Dependency' objects.
            If you need other data included, you can extend the schema and reference the
            'Raw' property on the dependency objects: this contains the raw data from the psd1
