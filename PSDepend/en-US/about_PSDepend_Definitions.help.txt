LONG DESCRIPTION
    PSDepend has several configuration definitions to work with:

        Dependency configurations:      *.Depend.psd1 script files
        Dependency type configurations:  Map Dependency types to scripts that run them

    Please see about_PSDepend or other general PSDepend help for clarification on terminology

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

    Dependency Configurations: *.Depend.psd1
    =========================================

        These are PowerShell data files that tell PSDepend what to install.

        We use the following attributes:

            DependencyFile: File that we read a dependency from
            DependencyName: Unique name within a dependency file - this is the key, the rest of the data is stored in this key's value.
            DependencyType: The dependency type.  Defaults to PSGalleryModule
            Name:           Name of the thing to deploy.  Optional, use this if DependencyName has a collision
            Version:        Version to install and check for.  The dependency script author is responsible for testing whether this version already exists and installing it if not.
            Parameters:     Optional parameters if the dependency type's script takes parameters.  For example, the PSGalleryModule has an optional 'Repository' parameter.
            Source:         Optional source.  For example, a FileDownload source is a URL
            Target:         Optional target.  For example, a PSGalleryModule can target a path (uses Save-Module), or a scope like AllUsers (uses Install-Module)
            AddToPath:      Optional flag to specify whether to add the installed dependency to the PATH (or PSModulePath, or comparable setting)
            Tags:           Optional tags to categorize and filter dependencies
            DependsOn:      Dependency that this Dependency depends upon.  Uses DependencyName for reference.
            PreScripts:     One or more paths to scripts to process before the dependency is processed
            PostScripts:    One or more paths to scripts to process after the dependency is processed
            Raw:            Raw data from the dependency in the psd1 file

        A *.depend.ps1 file will have one or more dependency nodes like this:

            @{
                # This means 'install the latest copy of pester if I don't have it already, for all users, via PSGalleryModule'
                # We treat the value as a 'Version, if it's not a hashtable
                pester = 'latest'

                # Install a specific version of psake for all users via PSGalleryModule
                psake = '4.6.0'

                # Install the latest buildhelpers module from PSGalleryModule, for the CurrentUser only
                buildhelpers = @{
                    target = 'CurrentUser'
                }

                # This is a fleshed out dependency that doesn't rely on default values
                # Maybe I need multiple copies of PSDeploy, so I give the key a unique name...
                psdeploy_0_1_8 = @{

                    # This overrides the name that typically comes from the key
                    name = psdeploy

                    # We want a specific version
                    version = '0.1.8'

                    # We want to install to a specific path
                    target = 'C:\ProjectX'

                    # This is the default, but specified for clarity...
                    DependencyType = 'PSGalleryModule'

                    # Parameters specific to our PSGalleryModule dependency type
                    parameters = @{
                        # We want to install from an internal repository named MyPSGalleryRepository, that I've already registered
                        Repository = 'MyPSGalleryRepository'
                    }

                    # Tag it.  Maybe only install in certain scenarios
                    tags = 'prod'

                    # Add to the PSModulePath
                    AddToPath = $True

                    # Make sure buildhelpers installs first
                    DependsOn = 'buildhelpers'

                    # Run this script after installing the module
                    PostScripts = "C:\Finalize-ProjectX.ps1"
                }
            }

    Dependency type map: PSDeployMap.psd1
    ================================

    This is a file that tells PSDeploy what script to use for each DeploymentType. By default, it sits in your PSDeploy module folder.

    There are two scenarios you would generally work with this:

      - You want to extend PSDeploy to add more DeploymentTypes
      - You want to move the PSDeploy.yml to a central location that multiple systems could point to

    There are three attributes to each DeploymentType in this file:

        DeploymentType Name:  The name of this DeploymentType
        Script:               The name of the script to process these DeploymentTypes
                              This looks in the PSDeploy module path, under PSDeployScripts
                              You can theoretically specify an absolute path
        Description:          Description for this DeploymentType. Provided to a user when they run Get-PSDeploymentType.

    The PSDeploy.yml file will have one or more DeploymentType blocks like this:

        Filesystem:
          Script: Filesystem.ps1
          Description: Uses the current session and Robocopy or Copy-Item for folder and file deployments, respectively.
